# Repository Guidelines

- The `streamlit_lmp_log_reader/` directory contains the Streamlit app source, its `requirements.txt`, and utilities for parsing LAMMPS logs.
- Use `streamlit run streamlit_lmp_log_reader/app.py` from the repository root to launch the local development server.
- Keep documentation concise and action-oriented so hydrogen storage researchers can quickly evaluate features and workflows.
- When modifying code, prefer small, well-named functions and include docstrings that clarify how the logic supports LAMMPS log analysis.
- Before committing, run available linters or tests to ensure the app remains ready for Streamlit Community Cloud deployments.
